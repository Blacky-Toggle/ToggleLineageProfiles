# Toggle Lineage Profiles

This app allows to quickly toggle any of the system profiles of LineageOS/Cyanogenmod using a widget from the home screen.

It only works if you have LineageOS/Cyanogenmod 13 or higher installed in your device.

The functionalities are:

* Having the widget in the home screen you know easily which profile is active at any moment.
* Customize the icons and colors of the profiles to be shown in the widget.
* Get a notification when some special profile is activated. For example, if you have a profile that disables the lock screen and it is automatically activated in some circumstances, you may want to get a notification when it is activated.
* Two ways of switching from one profile to another:
  * Using a popup window that shows the list of existing profiles and lets you select the one to activate.
  * Quick toggle from one profile to the next every time you click in the widget.
